# Edge Types Detection in Undirected Graph
 The Edge Types Detection in Undirected Graph project involves detecting and counting various edge types in an undirected graph. By applying a COMPLETE-DFS (Depth-First Search) on the entire graph, this project aims to determine and quantify the different types of edges present in the graph.
