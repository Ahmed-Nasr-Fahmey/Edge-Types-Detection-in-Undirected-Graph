# Edge Types Detection in Undirected Graph

## Description

The "Edge Types Detection in Undirected Graph" project involves detecting and counting various edge types in an undirected graph. By applying a COMPLETE-DFS (Depth-First Search) on the entire graph, this project aims to determine and quantify the different types of edges present in the graph.

## Problem Statement

The primary objective is to analyze the graph's edges and classify them into three categories: backward edges, forward edges, and cross edges. To ensure consistency in cases where ties occur, vertices are selected in ascending numeric order during the search process.

## Key Features

- **Edge Type Classification**: Develop an algorithm to classify edges into three types: backward edges, forward edges, and cross edges.

- **DFS Implementation**: Implement a COMPLETE-DFS strategy to traverse the entire graph and identify edge types.

- **Consistent Vertex Selection**: Resolve ties during the search by selecting vertices in ascending numeric order.

## Implementation

The project involves implementing a single function:

- **DetectEdges**: A method that takes an array of vertices and an array of edges as input. It detects and classifies the edge types and returns an array of three numbers: the number of backward edges, the number of forward edges, and the number of cross edges.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in the "Edge Types Detection in Undirected Graph" project, participants will achieve the following learning objectives:

- Develop problem-solving skills in graph traversal and edge classification.

- Gain experience in designing algorithms to detect and categorize different types of edges.

- Understand the importance of tie-breaking strategies to ensure consistent results.

## Outcome

Upon completion, participants will have a functional algorithm that showcases their ability to analyze graph structures and classify edges into distinct types. This project emphasizes skills in algorithmic thinking, graph theory, and data structure manipulation, which are valuable in various domains such as network analysis, computational biology, and optimization.
